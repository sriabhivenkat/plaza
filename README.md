## Plaza

People using Plaza won't ever have to pay to put their research project on a journal again. Publish research onto this website for everyone to see. People clicking on research papers must watch a 30 second ad before they are able to access the research paper and 40% of the total revenue generated from the clickstream is given to the researchers who put their paper on our platform.

I used a React.js frontend and a Firebase backend. Check us out on www.papersplaza.com! This website is still a work in progress, with an app on the way!
